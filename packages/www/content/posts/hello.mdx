Hopefully this will work and actually render something. That would make me happy.

```typescript
/** 
 * This is a comment
*/

function hello(woah) {
    lala((blah) => {
        let x = foo ? bar : baz;
        const bool = false
    })
}

class Greeter extends Usher {
    hello(greeting: string) {
        return `Hello, ${greeting}` // This is also a comment
    }

    goodbye(name) {
        return "Goodbye " + name + "."
    }
}

```
